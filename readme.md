I followed this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7GrYljPP2w&list=PLOZ3CbLbuxPwQvkDMBiIe4v1pTwAE380z
on how to design the dialogue UI and the Graph view dialogue tree

I change the character to a free robot gunner character from untiy asset store https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/robots/robot-hero-pbr-hp-polyart-106154 

The dialogue is about FPS shoot zombie game, when the player character meet the NPC general and receive mission

Model-View-Controller pattern✅
encode the dialogue information (the “model”) as ScriptableObjects✅
localization(English, Chinese, French, Spanish)✅
at least 4 diﬀerent responses✅
creating and editing many dialgoue trees✅
cycles within dialogue tree✅
